# calculatorApp 
##by Taras Zelenenkyy
hey, I created this app as a project to pass time. All of this is created using
Android Studio 1.5.1 I am not making profit from this. 

This is a work in progress and not even close to being done.

I do not allow anyone to use my code for their own profit but encourage
everyone to learn, thanks.  :)

###Feature list
Updated as often as I get ideas.

####Simple Calculations - Page
    Only very basic calculations. (enough function for a cashier)
####Scientific Calculations - Page
    More uncommon functions. (scientific calculator clone)
####Graphing - Page
    Graph your function. The input will be a function with x y to graph. 
####Measurement conversion - Page
    Convert different units to others.
